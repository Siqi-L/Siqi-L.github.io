<h3>Course description:</h3>
The purpose of this course is to offer a graduate level introduction to expanders and high-dimensional expanders. Expanders are sparse and well-connected graphs that have been studied intensively and applied broadly in computer science for decades. In the first half of the course we will study constructions of sparse expanders and explore their connections to coding theory, sampling, and pseudorandomness. In the second half of the course we will consider the generalization of expansion to hypergraphs. We will introduce several different definitions of high-dimensional expanders and take a closer look at spectral, combinatorial, and topological properties and also their applications to sampling and property testing.

<h3>Prerequisites: </h3>
This is intended as an introductory graduate course. Students should have prior exposure to linear algebra, probability, discrete math, and computational complexity theory. Students should be mathematically mature and will be expected to write proofs and read research papers.
